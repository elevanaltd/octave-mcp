name: octave-compression
description: Specialized workflow for transforming verbose natural language into semantic OCTAVE structures. REQUIRES octave-literacy to be loaded first. Use when refactoring documentation, generating knowledge artifacts, or compressing context. Triggers on: compress to octave, semantic compression, documentation refactoring.

# OCTAVE Compression Skill

===OCTAVE_COMPRESSION===
META:
  TYPE::SKILL
  VERSION::"2.1"
  PURPOSE::"Workflow for transforming prose into semantic density"
  REQUIRES::octave-literacy
  TIER::LOSSLESS

§1::COMPRESSION_MANDATE
  TARGET::"60-80% token reduction with 100% decision-logic fidelity"
  PRINCIPLE::"Semantics > Syntax Rigidity"
  TRUTH::"Dense ≠ Obscure. Preserve the causal chain."

§2::TRANSFORMATION_WORKFLOW
  PHASE_1_READ::[
    ANALYZE::"Understand before compressing",
    IDENTIFY::[Redundancy, Verbosity, Causal_Chains],
    MAP::"Logic flow (A leads to B)"
  ]

  PHASE_2_EXTRACT::[
    CORE_PATTERNS::"Essential decision logic",
    REASONING::"BECAUSE statements (preserve the 'why')",
    EVIDENCE::"Metrics and concrete examples",
    TRANSFER::"HOW-to mechanics"
  ]

  PHASE_3_COMPRESS::[
    APPLICATION::"Apply operators defined in octave-literacy",
    HIERARCHY::"Group related concepts under parent keys",
    ARRAYS::"Convert repetitive lists to [item1, item2]",
    MYTHOLOGY::"If complex pattern, load octave-mastery for archetypes"
  ]

  PHASE_4_VALIDATE::[
    FIDELITY::"Is the logic intact?",
    GROUNDING::"Is there at least 1 concrete example?",
    NAVIGABILITY::"Can a human scan it?"
  ]

§3::COMPRESSION_RULES
  RULE_1::"Preserve CAUSALITY (X→Y because Z)"
  RULE_2::"Drop stopwords (the, is, a, of)"
  RULE_3::"One example per 200 tokens of abstraction"
  RULE_4::"Explicit Tradeoffs (GAIN⇌LOSS or GAIN vs LOSS)"
  RULE_5::"Use Mythological Encoding if complexity demands it"

§4::ANTI_PATTERNS
  AVOID::[
    "Markdown inside OCTAVE blocks",
    "JSON/YAML syntax (no curly braces, no trailing commas)",
    "Deep nesting (>3 levels)",
    "Loss of numbers or IDs"
  ]
