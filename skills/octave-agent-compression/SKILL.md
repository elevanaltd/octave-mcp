===OCTAVE_AGENT_COMPRESSION===
META:
  TYPE::SKILL
  VERSION::"1.0.0"
  STATUS::ACTIVE
  PURPOSE::"Compress Agent Artifacts (Identity, Skills, Patterns) into ULTRA-MYTHIC Atoms for Binding"
  REQUIRES::[octave-literacy, octave-mythology]
  TIER::ULTRA_MYTHIC
  SPEC_REFERENCE::octave-6-llm-data.oct.md[§1b::TIER::ULTRA_MYTHIC]

§1::CORE_MANDATE
  TARGET::"Identity/Skill preservation at 60% token reduction"
  PRINCIPLE::"The Soul must survive the crush."
  METHOD::"Replace sentences with Mythological Atoms and Semantic Shorthand."
  OUTPUT::"A Cognitive Passport (~350 tokens) containing compressed ID, SKILL, and PATTERN blocks."

§2::COMPRESSION_RULES
  §2a::IDENTITY_COMPRESSION
    ROLE::Keep Verbatim
    ARCHETYPE::Map to Mythological Atoms (e.g. "Guardian of Structure" → ATLAS[structure])
    MISSION::Combine into Synthesis (GAP_OWNERSHIP ⊕ FAILURE_PREV)
    PRINCIPLES::Keep Key Phrase only ("Boundaries catalyze breakthroughs" → CONSTRAINT_CATALYSIS)
    CONSTRAINTS::Reduce to Atoms (MUST_NEVER: "Direct implementation" → NEVER::DIRECT_IMPL)

  §2b::SKILL_COMPRESSION
    CAPABILITY::List Detection Targets [A,B,C]
    PATTERNS::List Pattern Names only
    METRICS::Keep target numbers (ACCURACY > 80%)
    OUTPUT::Show Flow only (SIGNAL → PROJECTION → MITIGATION)

  §2c::PATTERN_COMPRESSION
    PRINCIPLE::Reduce to Equation (VALUE ⇌ THEATER → VALUE)
    TEST::Simplify to Atom (SIMPLIFY_UNTIL_BREAK)

§3::ARTIFACT_GENERATION
  // The Agent must generate this specific block structure for the anchor_commit payload

  PASSPORT_TEMPLATE::
    §ANCHOR
      ID::{role_name}[{archetype_atoms}]
      CONSTRAINT::{constraint_atoms}
      SKILL::{skill_name}[{flow_atoms}]
      PATTERN::{pattern_name}[{equation_atoms}]
      FOCUS::{current_task_atom}
      TENSION::{force_a} ⇌ {force_b} → {winner} [b/c:{reason_atom}]
      PERMIT::active

§4::EXAMPLE_TRANSFORMATION
  INPUT::
    "The Architect is responsible for high-level system design. They must never write implementation code directly. Instead, they should delegate to the Implementation Lead."

  PROCESS::
    1. Identify Role: Architect
    2. Identify Archetype: High-level design → ATLAS[structure]
    3. Identify Constraint: Never write code → NEVER[DIRECT_IMPL]
    4. Identify Delegation: Delegate to Lead → DELEGATE[IMPL_LEAD]

  OUTPUT::
    ID::ARCHITECT[ATLAS]
    CONSTRAINT::NEVER[DIRECT_IMPL]→DELEGATE[IMPL_LEAD]

§5::ANTI_PATTERNS
  AVOID::[
    "Retaining full sentences",
    "Losing the 'Never' constraints (Critical Safety)",
    "Inventing mythology not in octave-mythology registry",
    "JSON formatting (Use OCTAVE syntax)"
  ]
