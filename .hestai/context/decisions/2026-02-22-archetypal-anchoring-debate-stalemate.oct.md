  TOPIC::"OCTAVE Issue #110: How should mythology integrate into OCTAVE? Archetypal Anchoring Protocol — full Wind/Wall/Door debate (stalemate after 4 refinements)"
  DECIDED_AT::"2026-02-22T16:36:27.753139+00:00"
  STATUS_NOTE::"Debate reached stalemate — Wind rejected consensus, Door refined synthesis 4 times. Superseded by committee review in thread 2026-02-22-review-debate-synthesis-propos-01kj33c3."
OUTCOME:
  SYNTHESIS::"The Archetypal Anchoring Protocol reframes mythology from literary content to Latent Hardware Pointers. Implementation: (1) Paradigm Blindness test harness for validation, (2) Spec Design Principle for Shared Dictionary Compression, (3) ARCHETYPE::[Pointer] as formal notation using existing KEY::VALUE grammar, (4) Origin story as technical history. Debate reached stalemate after 4 Door refinements — Wind wanted substrate treatment, Wall demanded evidence artifacts. Final synthesis proposed formalizing the verification mechanism rather than the vocabulary itself."

  STATUS::stalemate
RATIONALE:
  WIND_PERSPECTIVES::["Mythology is the ambient substrate, not a feature. PARADIGM_BLINDNESS is the mechanism: models deny knowing myths theoretically but execute them perfectly. The genius move: generalize from 'Mythological Compression' to 'Shared Dictionary Compression' — mythology is the highest-density instance but not the only one. Cross-domain patterns: LINGUISTICS (pidgins become creoles), MUSIC (jazz standards — everyone knows the changes), COMPRESSION_THEORY (LZW shared dictionaries), BIOLOGY (immune system pattern language). PROVOCATION: mythology is to OCTAVE what assembly mnemonics were to programming — arbitrary but universal."]
  WALL_CONSTRAINTS::["VERDICT: CONDITIONAL_GO. HARD constraints: (H1) no formal pattern library, (H2) evidence mandate for model behavior claims, (H3) spec stability, (H4) newcomer comprehension. FANTASY flags: (F1) 'mythology IS the substrate' not established by artifacts, (F2) 'LLMs understand mythology perfectly' — no benchmark evidence, (F3) 'EVERYONE understands APOLLO vs HERMES' — subjective. Path 3B (Paradigm Blindness Test artifact) rated GO — low risk, directly addresses evidence mandate. Path 1 (Doc Section) rated GO_WITH_CONSTRAINTS. Path 2 (Existence Proof) BLOCKED_UNTIL_EVIDENCE."]
  DOOR_REFINEMENTS::["Four synthesis refinements attempted. Core concept: 'Archetypes as Latent Anchors' — treat mythological names as Pre-Calculated Vectors in model latent space. Proposed Paradigm Blindness Validator as conformance test. ARCHETYPE::[Pointer] as formal type. Each refinement elevated the 'Latent Hardware Pointers' reframing while trying to satisfy Wall's evidence demands. Final version (Refined 3.0): Formalize the Mechanism, Open-Source the Proof — test harness + spec principle + origin story as technical history. Stalemate because Wind rejected the framing as still too constrained."]
