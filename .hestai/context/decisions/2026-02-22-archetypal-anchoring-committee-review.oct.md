  TOPIC::"Review: Debate synthesis proposes 'Archetypal Anchoring Protocol' for OCTAVE Issue #110 — mythology as verified compression primitives, not a pattern library"
  DECIDED_AT::"2026-02-22T16:42:50.286784+00:00"

OUTCOME:
  SYNTHESIS::"1. All three agents agree: no grammar/parser changes for ARCHETYPE — existing KEY::VALUE handles it. 2. Critical Engineer BLOCKED the synthesis as-proposed due to scope violation (test harness = LLM behavior testing, not format processing) and over-engineering. 3. Requirements Steward flagged naming violation — 'Protocol' is over-engineering for what is a documentation principle. 4. Design Architect approved with refinements — treat ARCHETYPE as vocabulary convention not syntax. 5. Consensus path: doc-level principle describing 'shared dictionary compression', one worked example, optional non-blocking research harness under evidence/, no grammar changes, no validator changes. 6. The debate synthesis had a genius core (Latent Hardware Pointers as reframing) but over-engineered the delivery mechanism."

    "COMMITTEE_RESPONSES — Requirements-Steward: [ALIGNED_WITH_CORRECTIONS] ARCHETYPE:: is Vocabulary not Grammar. Test harness is POTENTIAL_VIOLATION of IS_NOT agent_orchestration_system. Protocol naming is VIOLATION (over-engineering) — rename to Pattern/Principle. Critical-Engineer: VERDICT BLOCKED as synthesized — debate ended in stalemate not consensus, ARCHETYPE already parses as KEY::VALUE, paradigm blindness harness is LLM behavior testing NOT format processing. Simplest path: doc principle + worked example + non-blocking evidence harness + NO grammar changes. Design-Architect: APPROVED_WITH_REFINEMENTS — use Standard KEY::VALUE convention, rebrand to 'Latent Hardware Pointers', implement as vocabulary validator extension not parser change.",
