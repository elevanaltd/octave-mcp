  TOPIC::"How should OCTAVE lean into mythological vocabulary? Permission vs formalization — the Mythological Compression Principle"
  DECIDED_AT::"2026-02-22T16:27:32.637092+00:00"
OUTCOME:
  SYNTHESIS::"1. Wind proposed mythology as a native compression layer with a 10-tradition guide and examples per tradition. 2. Wall constrained this: the spec defines grammar not vocabulary; a formal guide is a pattern library in disguise; the paradox itself proves teaching is redundant. 3. Door synthesized: the Mythological Compression Principle — mythology is OCTAVE's native compression dialect, not its grammar. Permission, not formalization. 4. Deliverable: one documentation section naming 10 traditions as a spectrum with 3-5 total examples. No spec changes, no pattern library, no formal mappings. 5. Issue #110 closed with this decision: mythological pattern library rejected as formal construct; Mythological Compression Principle adopted as documentation philosophy."

  STATUS::synthesis
RATIONALE:
  WIND_PERSPECTIVES::["MYTHOLOGY_AS_NATIVE_COMPRESSION_LAYER — LLMs ALREADY speak mythology fluently. The paradigm blindness paradox means we don't need to TEACH, we need to PERMIT. Proposed 10-tradition guide with examples: Greek (highest saturation), Norse (RAGNAROK::SYSTEM_COLLAPSE), Hindu (KARMA::FEEDBACK_LOOP), Egyptian (ANUBIS::JUDGEMENT_GATE), Japanese (KINTSUGI::BEAUTIFUL_REPAIR). Zero implementation cost, infinite compression surface, self-documenting, cross-model portable."]
  WALL_CONSTRAINTS::["VERDICT: Mythology belongs in spirit, not specification. Wind's 10-tradition guide is a pattern library in disguise. EVIDENCE: (E1) Spec defines grammar not vocabulary. (E2) Single developer — more surface = more debt. (E3) If LLMs already understand zero-shot, formal guide is redundant. (E4) Mythology-heavy guide signals niche tool. (E5) Cultural sensitivity concern with reductive mappings. CONSTRAINT: At most ONE paragraph of encouragement, not a catalogue."]
  DOOR_REFINEMENTS::["The Mythological Compression Principle — Neither Library Nor Silence. The resolution: if paradigm blindness is real (JOURNEY::ODYSSEAN works zero-shot), then teaching is redundant and permission is sufficient. Deliverable: one section naming 10 traditions as SPECTRUM (not dictionary), 3-5 total examples, ending with 'Use mythology freely. Models already understand.' Wind gets mythology elevated; Wall gets no spec changes. The deeper insight: mythology works because the semantic payload is already pre-loaded in every LLM's weights."]
