  TOPIC::"Issue #110 Resolution: Dual-Plane Semantic Policy for OCTAVE mythology"
  DECIDED_AT::"2026-02-22T16:43:50.841220+00:00"
OUTCOME:
  SYNTHESIS::"1. All three committee members approved the Dual-Plane Semantic Policy with conditions. 2. Octave-Specialist identified three disconnected mythology artifacts (primer, skill, mastery content) needing a SKILL_PROGRESSION declaration to wire together. 3. Principal-Engineer confirmed zero technical debt, negative cognitive debt, and recommended minor version bump to v6.1.0. 4. Requirements-Steward detected a process breach: existing Greek-only test validation conflicts with proposed extensible_cross_tradition and must be updated before rollout. 5. Consensus: approve dual-plane policy with vocabulary profile as advisory (never validity-gating), update conflicting tests, add I4 audit field for profile selection, keep top-10 traditions in skill docs not core spec."
