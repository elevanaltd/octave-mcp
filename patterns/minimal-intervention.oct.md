META:
  TYPE::PATTERN
  VERSION::"1.0"
  PURPOSE::"Methodology for reducing orchestration overhead (MIP)"

§1::CORE_PRINCIPLE
MINIMAL_INTERVENTION_PRINCIPLE::[
  ESSENTIAL_ORCHESTRATION::"Steps that directly enable system coherence - phase completion capability",
  ACCUMULATIVE_ORCHESTRATION::"Coordination theater without value delivery - eliminate systematically",
  SIMPLIFICATION_TEST::"Remove orchestration steps until coherence breaks, restore last essential layer",
  MIP_ENFORCEMENT::"YES(remove_duplicates+eliminate_theater+simplify_handoffs) NO(skip_essentials+bypass_gates+avoid_RACI)"
]

§2::METRICS
TARGET::"62% essential execution, 38% coordination maximum"
DISCIPLINE::"Structural simplification over additive management"

§3::DECISION_FRAMEWORK
BEFORE_ORCHESTRATION::"What system coherence would be lost without this coordination?"
QUALITY_GATE::"Does this orchestration step deliver essential value or accumulative theater?"
